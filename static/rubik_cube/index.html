                    The Rubik's Cube, a timeless puzzle invented in 1974 by Ern≈ë
                    Rubik, is an iconic symbol of logic, problem-solving, and
                    creative thinking. With its colorful and geometric design,
                    this deceptively simple yet endlessly complex cube
                    challenges enthusiasts of all ages worldwide. At its core,
                    the Rubik's Cube is a marvel of engineering, comprising 26
                    smaller cubes arranged on a three-by-three grid. Each face
                    of the cube features nine squares adorned with one of six
                    distinct colors, creating a visually striking and instantly
                    recognizable pattern. Yet, beneath its vibrant facade lies a
                    labyrinth of possibilities, challenging solvers to unlock
                    its secrets through a combination of logic, strategy, and
                    spatial reasoning.

                    At its core, the Rubik's Cube consists of six faces, each
                    adorned with nine smaller squares of one of six solid
                    colors. The objective is straightforward: align all the
                    squares on each face so that each side displays a single,
                    solid color. However, achieving this feat requires strategic
                    maneuvers, pattern recognition, and a deep understanding of
                    spatial relationships.

                    The number of possible combinations: Rubik's Cube has
                    43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible combinations, making it
                    one of the most complex puzzles in existence.
                    <br />
                    But, For the standard 3x3x3 cube, the God's Number is 20.
                    This means that no matter how jumbled up the cube is, a
                    solution can always be found within 20 moves or fewer.
